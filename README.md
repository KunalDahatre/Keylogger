# Keylogger
Keylogger is Detection and Prevention System that can monitor user system behavior, detect suspicious keystroke logging activities, and prevent potential data breaches. The system will use a combination of behavioral analysis, system call monitoring, and heuristics to identify and flag processes that attempt to log keystrokes without user consent.
